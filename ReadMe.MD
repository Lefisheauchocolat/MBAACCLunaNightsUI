# Melty Blood Luna Nights Again Current Code 
GitHub repository for an MBAACC mod that mainly replaces the vanilla UI with a Touhou Luna Nights styled interface using ripped and edited assets from the game. 

### What the hell does this include?

Files for vanilla stages with the foreground grass layer removed, custom character select and win screen songs, Luna Nights style UI and menu sounds.

### How the hell do I install this?

1. - Grab the File Extractor from [here](https://files.catbox.moe/ghmr93.zip) or from the included zip (File Extractor.zip) 
2. - Move dump.exe to the same folder as MBAA.exe
3. - Drag and drop the following .p files into dump.exe (a cmd window should pop up showing extraction progress): 

```
0000 (Stage files);
0001 (BGM files);
0003 (Visual assets);
0005 (SFX and voicelines); 
0007 (Story/Win quote files);
and 0008.p (Translation files).
```

1. \- Take everything inside the newly created "out" folder into the same folder as MBAA.exe
2. \- Rename the previously mentioned p files.
3. \- Put the mod files in the same folder as MBAA.exe, replacing files when prompted.

### Can I disable X part of the mod?
Most things, yes! Here's a quick list of things you can easily disable/enable:

- Edited Stages (aka. vanilla stages without the grass layer) - Rename 0000.p to enable, rename it back to 0000.p to disable;
- Custom music (for character select and win screen) - Rename 0001.p to enable, rename it back to 0001.p to disable;
- Custom UI - Rename 0003 and 0008.p to enable, rename them back to their original names to disable;
- Custom menu sounds - Rename 0005.p to enable, rename it back to 0005.p to disable.
